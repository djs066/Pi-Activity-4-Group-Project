Simon says, but on the potato

Notes taken in class:
preferably use relative paths ("sounds/one.wav")
Professor higly reccomends using OS module, for os.path.join(" "), since it works across different types of OS
Main = module file, dev = professor's version. Should make branch names clearer when possible

To do:

Make sure LEDs work
Make sure sounds work
Add switches (and handle input)

Homework:

add scoring mechanism
increase speed over time
stop using leds in sequence after certain point
