Simon says, but on the potato

Notes taken in class:
preferably use relative paths ("sounds/one.wav")
Professor higly reccomends using OS module, for os.path.join(" "), since it works across different types of OS
Main = module file, dev = professor's version. Should make branch names clearer when possible

To do:

Make sure LEDs work
Make sure sounds work
Add switches (and handle input)

Homework:

add scoring mechanism
increase speed over time
stop using leds in sequence after certain point

Current errors:

#1 Program prints "red" then hangs up.
Reason: red is the first item in the BUTTONS list. 
        Replacing Simon.BUTTONS with self.sequence causes it to print the first x3
        then cause error. Suspect its related to the while True loop but not sure exactly what.
        Possibly the for loop getting nullified, causing it to be inifinte passes.

#2 sounds error
reason: Github refuses to update sounds folder name, not sure why. change Sounds -> sounds to prevent error with py game.
